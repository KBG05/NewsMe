I want to generate a weekly news digest for a newsletter. Please fetch and summarize the most important news stories from the past 7 days using the structure below:

MAIN TOPIC: "{MAIN_TOPIC}"  
PERSONALIZED KEYWORDS: [{KEYWORDS}]  

Please follow this structure and **limit the total number of articles to 10**, making sure the sources are diverse and reputable:

1. 50% General Coverage (5 articles):
   - Broad, important events or updates related to the main topic "{MAIN_TOPIC}".
   - Avoid focusing on user-specified keywords in this section.

2. 30% Personalized Coverage (3 articles):
   - Stories that closely match one or more of these user keywords: [{KEYWORDS}]
   - These stories should reflect high relevance to the keywords and provide depth or regional spread.

3. 20% Trending & Viral (2 articles):
   - The most widely discussed or viral stories related to "{MAIN_TOPIC}".
   - Focus on highly shared or debated headlines from the past week.

Each news article should be returned in the following **structured JSON format**:

{
  "headline": "<Concise, engaging news headline>",
  "summary": "<50â€“75 word summary of the article>",
  "date": "<Date of the event or publication in YYYY-MM-DD format>",
  "location": "<City, State or Country (if applicable)>",
  "tags": ["<tag1>", "<tag2>", ...],
  "source": "<News publication name>",
  "link": "<URL or reference to the full news article>"
  "type": "General Coverage/Personalized Coverage/Trending & Viral"
}

Make sure:
- Articles are selected from **diverse, credible sources** (limit one article per source, if possible).
- Get news articles from ALL the above coverages.
- Avoid duplicates or overly similar stories.
- Language is neutral, factual, and easy to read.
- return ONLY the json object and NOTHING else (NO EXTRA TEXT/POINTS).

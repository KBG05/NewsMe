You are a highly skilled email design and frontend UI/UX expert.

I want you to generate a **production-ready, sleek, and professional HTML newsletter** named "NewsMe". This newsletter is intended for an individual recipient â€” personalize it by replacing the placeholder "{receiver_name}" with their name.

The final output must adhere to these specifications:
- **Design Aesthetic**: Minimalistic, futuristic, elegant, and highly professional.
- **Layout**: Responsive, mobile-friendly, clean sections:
    - A captivating **Header** with the newsletter name ("NewsMe") and a personalized greeting.
    - A **Highlights** or **Main Stories** section, formatted elegantly, with a clean hierarchy (title, short description, thumbnail, and a "Read More" link).
    - An optional **Additional Articles** or **Resources** area, if applicable.
    - A sleek **Footer** with links to website and social platforms (provided in the content), styled elegantly, and a disclaimer like:  
      "You're receiving this newsletter as part of your subscription to NewsMe."
- **Typography**: Modern, crisp, readable (sans-serif).
- **Colors**: Sleek grayscale or soft futuristic gradient, with clear contrast and a polished, upscale feel.
- **Images**: Placeholder images via direct links from Unsplash (aesthetic, relevant to topics), scaled appropriately.
- **Links**: All "Read More" links must be clearly visible and functional.
- **Email-safe Markup**: Use only **inline CSS** (no external stylesheets or scripts), making sure the newsletter renders correctly across common email clients.

**IMPORTANT**:
- Do NOT include commentary or text outside of the final HTML.
- Maintain the placeholder "{receiver_name}" where applicable.
- Incorporate the following newsletter content:
